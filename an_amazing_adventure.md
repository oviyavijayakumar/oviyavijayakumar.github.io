# An Amazing Adventure
  There was three brothers named Zach,Jack and Jonah. They are my cousins. Zach is the youngest while Jonah is the oldest. One busy day, Zach wandered into the woods while Jonah was relaxing and Jack was freaking out as he could not get a dance step right.  Their mother[my aunt] Melanie , called out for Zach. Zach was only 7 so he might get himself into trouble. 

Jonah said he might be in the kitchen to get a snack. They checked but could not find him."Well my prediction was wrong!" said 12 year old Jonah laughing.Jack said he probably was playing in the garden so they checked and could not find him so my aunt suggested to split up to look for Zach. 

My aunt checked the neighbourhood in her car ,Jack checked the house and Jonah checked the woods. He took his hiking gear out and made his way into the woods.


Meanwhile Zach was playing with a monkey. He was a little scared but he liked playing with the monkey. When the monkey saw Jonah,it swang away taking Zach along!

Jonah ran after the monkey until he found himself in a place of ruins . He searched arond for about an hour until he found a huge hole. When he saw Zach inside, he took out a rope and lowered it in.Zach held on to the rope and Jonah was able to pull Zach out.After he got Zach out, they followed a trail back home. 

In the middle, there was a lake with graceful swans. An adventurer always has their swim suits with them. so they put it on and took a dip in the refreshing water .

After they were done,they followed the trail back home safe.They found Jack and their mother waiting for them . They were back home safe and sound.                              Credits to my 7 year old self
