# My First Time Ever
My name is Olivia. I live in the northern side of Alaska.I also happen to live with overprotecting parents and they don't let me go out or anything! Whenever I see out of the window,I see 
 my friends play outside. It seems marvellous to be out there! They call me out but I have to deny their requests everytime! Now my parents sadly died a week ago. I live with my uncle now and he is not so overprotective. I asked him if I could go down to play with my friends and he replied with a yes! I wrapped myself up in jeans,a jacket, my gloves,earmuffs and boots.I stepped out and took a deep breath full of fresh air. As I took a step, I heard the snow crunch under my feet. Crunch,Crunch,Crunch it went.I leaned down to touch it and I could not believe it !The snow was incredibly soft! I was right ! It was marvellous to be out here!When I came back in, I found a cup of hot coco waiting for me . I bundled up in front of the fireplace and said,"That was an incredible first!"
