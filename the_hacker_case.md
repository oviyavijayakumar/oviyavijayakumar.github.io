#The Hacker Case
It is my first day of my new job.I am investigating The Hacker Case. A guy named Tony has been hacked into. I am not doing this case alone though.I am doing this case with Olivia,the main detective.We decided to interrogate some of Olivia's past hackers. We brought Leah, suspect number 1 over. I was sent into the interrogation room with Leah. I asked her one simple question."Did you hack Tony's Twitter account?"."Huh, Twitter account.Ammuture hacker much. I hack the whole internet . I'm a master hacker."she replied."Well that was a bust" I thought to myself.
